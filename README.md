# tbFlickr : Backup all you flickr photos

## About

I love taking photos and find flickr a great place to store and share all of my photos.
I trust flickr on keeping my photos safe but you never know... 

I originally used [flickrtouchr](https://github.com/tbilou/hivelogic-flickrtouchr) to backup all my photos and it worked great.
In 2011 I replaced my flickr backup hard drive and had to start the backup from scratch.
I launched python and after a couple of days it was only at 33% complete. Downloading over 100.000 photos in a single thread was taking forever.
So I decided play around with the flickr api and write my own backup system.

## Goals

 * Multiple downloads to use available bandwidth.
 * Use hardlinks to save space
 * Learn something new
 * Have fun doing it
 * Actually use it to backup my photos

## Implementations

My first implementation was in 2011 using Tibco BW. It's a strange tool to implement a backup script but I was learning how to use it and this seemed like a good project to do it.

Later in 2012, inspired by my implementation in Tibco BW and by [this post](http://www.justincarmony.com/blog/2012/01/10/php-workers-with-redis-solo/) I've implemented a multi-thread/worker solution based on [Redis](http://redis.io/) first in JAVA and later in PHP.

I'm currently using the PHP version to backup my photos.
